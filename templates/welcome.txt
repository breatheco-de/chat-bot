Hello! We are so glad to have you as a student!

We've built this slack group to have a clear and direct communication channel with our students. Here are some of the specific #channels available:

- Academy News & Events: Most important news and events about the community and the tech community.
- Job Hunting: Looking for a job? This channel is for you! Fell free to post job oportunities, recomendations, etc. We will do the same!
- Random: Is there a new cool gadget out there? Any interesting stuff happening?

Feel free to reach us at any time to contact@4geeksacademy.com
